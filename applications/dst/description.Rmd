## Projekttitel / Project title

Interplay between diabetes and intergenerational transmission of health determinants over the life course

## Projektbeskrivelse / Project description

The overall aim of this project is to identify the contributions of family and
early life determinants on the development, management, and care of diabetes and
the diseases that may arise following a diabetes diagnosis, under a life-course
framework.

Diabetes is a complex, multi-factorial disease. Its development depends on the
timing and accumulation of exposures throughout the life-course. In addition to
genetic influences, behavioral risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cluster
in families and are passed through generations. For instance, poor childhood
socioeconomic status (SES) can impact final educational attainment, adult SES,
and lifestyle and behavioral characteristics, which ultimately influence an
individual's metabolic capacity to regulate glucose and subsequent risk for
diabetes.

This project will contribute to a broader and deeper understanding of the role
that these factors play with the development and progression of diabetes. For
this purpose, we will apply causal and predictive statistical methods to best
use the data available from the integrated data sources with an overarching goal
to model several potential public health strategies that might impact the
prevention and management of diabetes and the diseases that follow its
diagnosis. 

<!-- A key feature to this project is the integration of external data -->
<!-- sources, such as longitudinal cohort studies, with the register data. -->

## Population / Population

In order to identify familial relations through individuals' life course trajectory,
the population requested covers all individuals, who live or lived in Denmark 
from 1 January 1970 to 31 December 2020 (~8.5 million people). Key requirements are:

- All index individuals born or who migrated into Denmark on or after 1970-01-01.
- All family members of the index individuals, including parents, siblings,
spouses, and children.

## Variabelindhold / Variables included

All variables can be de-identified (direct identification is not needed). The
list of requested variables is found in the tables at the end of the document in 
the Appendix. For all the variables, we need the data from the first year it is
available to the most recent year it is available. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(glue)
# library(gt)
needed_registers <- here("data/needed-registers.csv") %>% 
    read_csv(col_types = "lddccccc") %>% 
    filter(!drop | is.na(drop))

dst_variables <- read_csv(here("data/dst-registers-with-variables-to-use.csv"))
dst_variables <- dst_variables %>%
    filter(use_in_application == 1,
           register_id %in% unique(needed_registers$register_id)) %>% 
    mutate(across(ends_with("year"), str_extract, pattern = "^\\d{4}")) %>% 
    mutate(start_year = case_when(
        is.na(variable_start_year) | variable_start_year == variable_end_year ~
            register_start_year,
        TRUE ~ variable_start_year
    )) %>% 
    select(register_id, register_name_dk, variable_name, start_year)

sds_variables <- read_csv(here("data/sds-registers-with-variables-to-use.csv"))
sds_variables <- sds_variables %>% 
    filter(use_in_application == 1) %>% 
    mutate(start_year = str_extract(periode, "^\\d{4}")) %>% 
    select(register_name, table_name, variable_name, start_year)

random_registers <- read_csv(here("data/random-undocumented.csv"))

authorized_researchers <-
    read_csv(
        here("data/authorized-researchers.csv"),
        col_types = cols(.default = col_character())
    )

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
```

Registers requested are:

```{r dst-register-list, results = "asis"}
needed_registers %>% 
    filter(!is.na(register_id) & owner == "dst") %>% 
    mutate(across(where(is.character), ~if_else(is.na(.), "TO UPDATE", .))) %>% 
    glue_data("- {register_id}: {register_name_dk} / {register_name_english}") %>% 
    sort() %>% 
    cat(sep = "\n")
```

In the Appendix we listed the ATC codes from the prescription register and ICD-8
and -10 codes from the patient register that we need to classify diabetes 
and the diseases that may arise following a diabetes diagnosis.

<!-- Please also include information on external data or own survey data if such -->
<!-- data is part of the project. In such cases please include approval from the -->
<!-- Danish Protection Agency. -->

## Særligt vedr. lægemiddelsdata / Especially regarding drug data 

The medication data we are requested are used in order to identify cases of disease
(e.g. diabetes) that might not have been diagnosed and recorded in the patient register.
The list of requested ATC codes is found in the Appendix section.

<!--
Only to be filled in if the project is to use drug data. Research projects that
must use data from the Medicines Database must be approved by the Danish Health
and Medicines Authority. The approval process takes place via a contact person
in Forskningsservice. Drug data may only be used for the purpose described in
this project setting. If drug data is to be used for other purposes, a renewed
approval from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority is required.
-->

## Offentliggørelse af resultater / Publication of results

Results will be published in open access scientific outlets and presented at
scientific conferences.

## Perspektivering / Perspective

Understanding how early life and familial factors can influence diabetes provides
us with tools and knowledge to better target, intervene, and either
prevent or manage diabetes and its complications. Considering the impact that
diabetes as a disease itself and its related comorbidities has at the personal,
public health, and economic level, any improvement in knowledge can have major 
impacts.
