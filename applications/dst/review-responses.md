# Comments and responses

**...shortly argue better to why you need full population**:

- We have updated the justification for the population, thanks!

**FTDB, FTDK and FTDM ... three are closed and possibly redundant**, need them?:

- We do still need them since we need them to help identify parental relations and biological parents.

**... you need to apply for permission for access [for LMDB] from Sundhedsdatastyrelsen.**:

- Yes, we plan on applying for it after finishing with this application.

**Statistic Denmark only have LPR data until 2018.**:

- This is fine for our planned projects, so far that we can see.

**... you do not apply for MFR, is that correct?**:

- That is correct. None of our planned projects require the more recent birth data from MFR. 

**... recommend you add the variable HF_VFRA**:

- Done! Thanks.

We've added another person (Anders) for his experience working with classifying diabetes and working within DST. We've also forgot to add the FTNAEVN register, which we added.
