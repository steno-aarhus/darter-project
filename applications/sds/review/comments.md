1.  **Processing of personally identifiable data**:
    -   I note that the submitted document is a notification for
        registration of the research project.
        -   I would like to ask you to confirm the actual approval from
            the institution responsible for the data.
    -   I read from the notification that the notified project has the
        title "Metabolic consequences of Early Life adversity and
        subsequent risk for type 2 Diabetes (MELD) Project." The title
        of the applied project is "Interplay between diabetes and
        intergenerational transmission of health determinants over the
        life course".
        -   I would like to ask you to ensure that it is the correct
            approval for data processing in this project.
2.  **Payment Information**:
    -   The attached document shows the following EAN number: ####. The
        EAN number must contain 13 digits. The transmission contains 14
        digits.
        -   I would like to ask you to send the correct EAN number.
3.  **National Patient Register Psychiatry (LPR-PSYK)**:
    -   It appears from the application that you only need data from
        LPR-PSYK and not from LPR and LPR3_F. LPR-PSYK contains complete
        data up to and including 31 December 2018. I would like to ask
        you to clarify whether you need data from LPR and/or LPR3_F.
4.  **The Medicines Database (LMDB)**:
    -   I must ask you to fill in the attached ATC code form.

## Response

1.  **Processing of personally identifiable data**:
    -   We had a discussion about this with the previous case worker. It
        seems, at least at Region Midt, that projects that are
        registered as
    -   The title difference is a mistake. That title in the project
        registration was the old title, we have updated the title with
        the present title.
2.  **Payment Information**:
    -   Sorry, there had been a copy-paste error from finance admin.
    -   Correct EAN number: 57980031841098
3.  **National Patient Register Psychiatry (LPR-PSYK)**:
    -   We discussed this with the previous case worker. From our
        understanding, since we have LPR from DST, we don't necessarily
        need it from SDS. However, we were unaware of LPR3 at the time
        of applying for the DST data and communication with the previous
        SDS case worker. What do you recommend? It seems that LPR3 has
        data starting from 2019 until present, correct? If that's the
        case, we would like to include LPR3 to identify more recent
        diabetes diagnoses and related complications.
4.  **The Medicines Database (LMDB)**:
    -   We filled in the form, which is attached.
