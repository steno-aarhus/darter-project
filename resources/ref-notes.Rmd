### Danish Civil Registration System (CRS) (by Schmidt)

doi:10.1007/s10654-014-9930-3

- Danish Health system has three layers:
    - state (federal government) that deals with laws, guidelines, and financing
    - regions that deal with delivering primary and secondary care
    - municipalities that deal with school health, child dental care, home nursing,
    public health, prevention, and rehab

- Started 1968
- Variables:
    - CPR number, migration and vital status (alive or dead), address,
    date and place of birth, citizenship, CPR numbers of parents and children, 
    sibling, civil status (married, etc).

- To access, need:
    - project approval from Data Protection Agency and maybe from National Committee on Health Research Ethics
    - project protocol
    - description of requested data

### Registers for Public Health: Introduction

doi:10.1177/1403494811409654

- Look into European Centre for Register-Based Health-Related Population
Research Public Health, Major Diseases and Welfare (ECREPH), University
of Southern Denmark (www.ecreph.org)

### Danish Medical Birth Register (MBR)

doi:10.1007/s10654-018-0356-1

- Established in 1973 but underwent major changes in construction and content
in 1997
    - After 1997, entry was electronic and the data entered through the
    National Patient Registry and then fed into the MBR.
- The Danish Health Data Authority administers the MBR
- Unlike the CVR, parents in the MBR are assumed to be the biological parents
    - In CVR they are the legal parents
- Main variables:
    - Mother, father, infant ID, date of birth, place of birth.
    - Maternal: Age, Height, Weight, Smoking
    - Pregnancy variables: ...(?)
    - Infant: Gestational age, congenital malformations, death within 12 months,
    short term characteristics (?)
- Between 1998-2004 and then in 2009, a lot of variables were added.
    - Including maternal weight, height starting in 2003 (same with smoking)
- For validity of medical coding, the more detailed the coding or medical procedure
done, the less valid the information is.
    - But basic information (non-medical procedures or diseases/complications)
    are of high validity.
- Data errors and problems are fixed throughout time, so most up-to-date version
of MBR is considered the most valid.
- The Danish Health Data Authority does not do data cleaning after entry,
so individual researchers are responsible for that. Any errors found by researchers
are not corrected in the register.
- Can access the data through either the DST or the DHDA.
    - The copy at DST is usually updated once per year
    - Data is made available at DHDA with as little as 1-2 months delay.

- NOTE: Table 1 is very useful, it has the danish names with the translation.

### Danish registers on personal labour market affiliation

doi:10.1177/1403494811408483

- Register-based Labour Force Statistics (RAS Statistics):
    - From 1981

    family and household, education, unemployment, income
- Labour Force Survey:
    - From 1984
    - E.g. variables: Working situation, working hours, SES
- Occupation usually defined based on "most important source of income"

### Danish education registers

doi: 10.1177/1403494810394715

- Registers for education:
    - Student Register (SR)
    - Academic Acheivement Register (AAR)
    - Population's Education Register (PER), most widely used.
    - Adult Education and Continuing Training Register (AR)
- Variables found in most of them:
    - Enrolment and completion dates, length of education (usually in months)
- Variables in SR and AAR:
    - Has individual level grades either average (since 1978) or subject-specific (since 1997)
- Variables SR2 and PER:
    - Has a digit code to indicate education completed
    - PERs has a code that can be translated to international code
    - DST recommends PER for general uses
- Generally from 1970s
- High validity and coverage.

### The Danish National Patient Registry

doi:10.2147/CLEP.S91125

- From 1978
- Variables:
    - Individual's residence
    - Hospital/region
    - Times specifications
    - Primary diagnosis
    - Secondary diagnosis
    - Complications
- There is a browser for looking through codes
    - https://www.medinfo.dk/sks/brows.php
- Diagnoses using ICD-8 until 1993, then ICD-10 afterward
- Given the administrative context of the register, validity may be a limitation
    - Maybe has between 60-80% of positive predictive value, better for recent years.

### The Family Relations Database

https://econ.au.dk/the-national-centre-for-register-based-research/danish-registers/the-family-relations-database/

- Linked with data from several other registers (Medical Birth Registry, the
Psychiatric Central Research Register, the National Patient Register, the In
Vitro Fertilization Register, the Cancer Register, and theRegister ofCauses of
Death.)
- Danish Health Data Authority (DHDA) manages this register
- Parental links (mother, father) to all persons born in Denmark from 1960 are
considered 100% correct.

### Danish System for Access to Micro Data

https://www.dst.dk/ext/645846915/0/forskning/Access-to-micro-data-at-Statistics-Denmark_2014--pdf

- CPR number first came about 1968
- In order to link non-DST data sources, need to get approval from 
Danish Data Protection Agency
- Check out:
    - the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research
    - Fertility Database
        - All references between child, mother, father from 1973
        - All mother-child reference from 1960
- Inside the research server environment at DST, 
if I want to send files to my own computer, I can store it in a special
file/location and it will be emailed to me.
    - These emails are tracked and checked, so be very careful.

- Only data required for the specific project will be given.
    - Application should document a reasonable relationship between 
    requested data and project description

## Danish National Birth Cohort

- Started from 1996
