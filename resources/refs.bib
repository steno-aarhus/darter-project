Three visits have been completed, totaling 6-years of follow-up.Individuals (n=477) at-risk for diabetes recruited from the general population in London and Toronto, Canada.Values from an oral glucose tolerance test were used to compute 1/HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index (ISI) for IS, and the Insulinogenic Index over HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2) for beta-cell function. Thin-layer-chromatograph and gas-chromatograph quantified FA. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used for the analysis.IS and beta-cell function declined by 8.3-19.4\% over 6-years. In fully adjusted GEE models, PL cis-vaccenate (18:1n-7) was positively associated with all outcomes, while gamma-linolenate (GLA; 18:3n-6) and stearate (18:0) were negatively associated with IS. Tests for time interactions revealed PL eicosadienoate (20:2n-6) and palmitate (16:0), and CE dihomo-gamma-linolenate (20:3n-6), GLA, and palmitate had stronger associations with the outcomes after longer follow-up.In a Canadian population at-risk for diabetes, we found that higher PL stearate and GLA, and lower cis-vaccenic acid, predicted consistently lower IS and beta-cell function over 6-years.},

  abstract  = {**Printed** The triple-logistic pattern of human growth in linear dimensions is probably one of the most recognizable models within human biology. The fact that postnatal somatic growth occurs in three phases (infancy, childhood, adolescence) creates opportunities for the individual expression of this genetically directed, but environmentally modified, phenomenon. The impact of the environment works to alter the duration and intensity of critical stages within the total process resulting in individual patterns that can differ radically from the general pattern. However, the constancy of the general pattern is so fixed that its presence in children is taken as a reflection of good health. Departures from that pattern are recognized as reflecting ill health. While the cessation of growth in response to an acute attack is uniformly dramatic, the gradual response to chronic adverse stimuli is less easily predicted and interpreted. For example, in chronic scenarios the loss of centile position that precedes the eventual establishment of normal increments can be viewed as either a poor or a good growth response, as either maladaptive or adaptive, as either poor health or good health. This article reviews such growth patterns in urban South African children exploring the relationship between environment and growth outcome.},
  comment   = {Three stages of growth: infancy, childhood, adolescence. Each stage represents an early rapid growth followed by a plateau until the next stage. Rapid postnatal growth until about 5, slow down til 6, increasing until 8, slows until 10-12 years and continues until cessation of growth. Those with low birthweight grow rapidly, those with higher birthweight grow slower. Very rapid growth until 2 years of age associated with greatest risk for chronic disease. Rapid growth outside of the expected is associated with chronic disease. Weight is eco-sensitive, while length is more responsive to chronic conditions of growth. Intrauterine growth restrictions (IUGR) or poor fetal conditions may lead to a positive response of reducing overall growth to adequately develop neural and vital tissue. Similarly rapid growth in infancy following IUGR may be viewed as positive given the IUGR and the infants need to grow. However, too much growth may be a bad thing. The earlier and greater the adipose rebound (significant increase in fat/BMI), the higher the risk for disease. Transition economies seeing children who are stunted as well as overweight. Born small and very rapid growth had greater glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.},

The study included a cross-sectional sample of 21,021 subjects ranging in age from 2 to 90 years who had anthropometric information and poverty income ratio that participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Survey {(NHANES} {III)} of the United Stated conducted during 1988-1994.

In both males and females and in all three ethnic groups and across socio-economic status (measured by the poverty income ratio) a low leg length index is associated with increased body fat (measured by skinfold thickness) when compared with those with high leg length index. It is postulated that a low leg length index reflects the consequence of negative environmental conditions leading to growth delay. Previous studies indicate that individuals exposed both during development and adulthood to under-nutrition respond through inter-related physiological mechanisms oriented at improving energetic efficiency and low oxidation of fat. These interrelated compensatory physiological adjustments work together to promote fat storage among growth delayed individuals or populations.},

This is a study of the associations of adult leg and trunk length with early life height and weight, diet, socioeconomic circumstances, and health, and parental height, divorce and death. Method. The data used were collected in a longitudinal study of the health, development and ageing of a British national birth cohort (N = 2879 in this analysis) studied since birth in 1946. Multiple regression models were used to investigate the relationships. Results. Adult leg and trunk length were each positively associated with parental height, birthweight, and weight at 4 years. Leg length was associated positively with breastfeeding and energy intake at 4 years. Trunk length was associated negatively with serious illness in childhood and possibly also parental divorce, but not with the dietary data. Conclusion. Adult leg length is particularly sensitive to environmental factors and diet in early childhood because that is the period of most rapid leg growth. Trunk growth is faster than leg growth after infancy and before puberty, and may be associated with the effects of serious illness and parental separation because of the child's growing sensitivity to stressful circumstances, as well as the result of the biological effects of illness.},
  comment       = {Intro: Methods: Medical research council national survey of health and development, social class stratified sample of 5362 of all single, legitimate births in England, Wales and Scotland from 3-9 march 1946. Last visited at 43 yrs, n=3262. Leg and trunk length, derived from sitting height. Birthweight recorded by midwive or obstetrician or taken from records by health visitors. Height and weight were taken at 4, 7, 11, 15. Parental height: mothers taken when child was 6, fathers was reported by mother. Breastfeeding reported by mother when child was 2. Nutrients were coded based on mothers 24 hr recall. Some nutrients associated with bone matrix, etc (used energy of prot, fat, carb, Ca, P, Mg, Zn, Fe, vit A, C, E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin. Child illness reported by mother, only serious if lasted longer then 3 months in any one year or one month in hospital between birth and 59 months. Reports of admission were checked with hospital records. SES was based on fathers occupation when child was 4 (manual and non-manual), overcrowding (>=2/rm). Parental seperation/death by age 6 was recorded. Leg and trunk were converted to z-scores, as well as a variable for the difference between leg and trunk z-scores. Energy intake and weight were natural logged and times by 100 to interpret the beta-coeff as a change per one percent. No interaction of sex, so sexes were combined. Age 4 used because diet info was taken then and because it is an early stage of growth. Results: leg > in men. Low correlation of leg to trunk (.1). Leg and trunk were pos assoc with parental height, greater for leg. Birthweight pos assoc with both components of ht. Non-manual social class > leg and trunk, greater for leg. Not breastfed < leg and trunk, considerably stronger for leg. Energy intake assoc with leg and trunk, stronger for leg. Adjust for energy intake, leg assoc with all nutrients, esp vit a, c, riboflavin, niacin, trunk assoc with vit c and e. Serious illness < trunk and leg, greater for trunk. Divorce < trunk, not leg. After adjusting for parent height, birthweight, SES, crowding, breastfeeding, and illness, no nutrient remained significant. SES, crowding, parent height accounted for reduction, so likely nutrients are a proxy for SES. Fathers SES and crowding were confounded, so SES was kept. Leg and nutrition was confirmed to be signif assoc (both breastfeed & energy intake). Parent height, birthweight and weight at 4 were all assoc independ with leg. Adjusting for height and weight at 4, fathers SES no longer signif. Height at 4 accounted for some of effect of breastfeeding and energy. Birthweight effect became smaller but still signif. Illness effect got smaller with each adjustment. Height & weight at 4 were strongly assoc with leg. All later child height pos assoc with leg. Height at 7, 11, 15 weakened effect of breastfeeding, energy intake and weight at 4. birthweight weakened only with height at 15. Illness reduced trunk, parent seperation < trunk. Weight and height at 4 weakend effect of father SES on trunk as well as parent seperation and illness. WEight and ht strongly pos assoc with trunk. All later height positive assoc with trunk. Parent seperation, birthweight, and weight at 4 unaltered with each later age height. Discussion: Leg length assoc with breastfeeding and energy. trunk with illness and parental seperation. Diet effects most evident on leg. Parental height may be a marker of SES. Being heavier at birth or at 4 or both pos effect on growth. Birthweight effect on both components of adult ht independ of prepub ht, suggesting prenatal growth has impact on absolute height, not on components. Weight at 4 may be a proxy for age of puberty as weight at 4 was strongly assoc with adult trunk, stronger for women. Thus, early maturers may have > trunk length but not leg. Leg assoc with breastfed and energy, but not illness and seperation, showing sensitivity of leg to early life environment. Trunk height appeared to be effected by longer term impacts while leg length assoc with nutrition and SES during infancy. Limitations: Leg length measurement error, mother reported father height.},

  abstract      = {** Printed ** Aims/hypothesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between components of adult height (leg length, trunk length, ratio of leg to trunk length) and Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. Methods. A cross sectional study was carried out on 4286 women of age 60 to 79 years from 23 towns across England, Scotland and Wales. Results. Total height was weakly and inversely associated with diabetes but this masked differences in the association with leg and trunk length. Leg length was inversely associated with Type II diabetes [age adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for diabetes for each standard deviation (4.3 cm) increase in leg length: 0.81 (0.73, 0.90)] whereas trunk length was not associated with diabetes [age adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) for diabetes for each standard deviation (3.6 cm) increase in trunk length: 1.05 (0.94, 1.18)]. Adjustment for potential confounding factors attenuated but did not remove the inverse association between leg length and the prevalence of diabetes: fully adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) per standard deviation increase in leg length was 0.87 (0.77, 0.98) and that per standard deviation increase in the ratio of leg to trunk length was 0.88 (0.78, 0.99). In non-diabetic women leg length was inversely associated with insulin resistance, whereas trunk length was positively associated with insulin resistance. Conclusion/interpretation. Leg length is an indicator of early childhood environmental circumstances, in particular of infant nutrition. These results suggest that poor infant nutrition is an important causal factor in the development of Type II diabetes and insulin resistance in later life.},

Analysis included quartiles of height components, linear and logistic regression, multiple logistic regression (assoc height components and diabetes prevalence), multiple linear regression (assoc ht comp and insulin resist), HOMA scores and TAG conc were log normal, geometric means shown and natural log of conc were used in reg models. HOMA was only tested on non-diabetic women. Results: 218/4286 had doc diagnosis of diabetes (209 after exculsion), 168/3824 had blood glucose >=7mmol/l. Total with WHO defined diabetes was 375, prevalence 8.97 percent (CI 8.08, 9.92). Variables for statistical significance: leg length - inversely assoc with age, diabetes prev, HOMA, SBP, TAG, and BMI - assoc with HDL and social class (childhood and current) - no assoc with DBP, LDL, waist:hip ratio, and smoker; trunk length - inversely assoc with age, SBP, DBP, HDL, waist:hip ratio, and smoking status - assoc with HOMA and social class (childhood and current) - no assoc with diabetes prev, LDL, TAG, and BMI; height - inversely assoc with age, diabetes prev, HOMA, SBP, TAG, and BMI - assoc with social class (childhood and current) - no assoc with DBP, HDL, LDL, and waist:hip ratio; leg-trunk ratio - inversely assoc with diabetes prev, HOMA, TAG, and BMI - assoc with age, HDL, waist:hip ratio, smoking status, and social class (current and childhood) - no assoc with SBP, DBP, and LDL. Odds ratios: leg length 0.71-0.97 CI across multiple models and adjustments; trunk length 0.88-1.18 over models and adjustments; height 0.77-1.03 over models and adjustments; leg:trunk ratio 0.71-0.98 over models and adjustments. Regression coefficient of logged HOMA (similair format to odds ratio): leg length -0.08-0.02; trunk length 0.01-0.06; height -0.04-0.01; leg:trunk ratio -0.10--0.04. In summary, leg length associated with reduced risk of diabetes independent of diabetes risk factors, trunk length was not (odds ratio). In reg coeff, leg length was inversely assoc with IR, trunk was positively assoc with IR. Self-reported birthweight was positively assoc with leg length and trunk length (subgroup, those who indicated their birthweight n=1419). Discussion: Adult height is correlated to birthweight. Important determinant of leg length and trunk length is early childhood environment, especially infant nutrition. Increasing IR and decreasing leg length likely reflect poor chilldhood conditions. But positive association between trunk length and IR "harder to explain" but could be due to trunk length strongly assoc with pubertal growth, which is assoc with GH and IGF surges, leading to long term effects on IR. Limitations: 60% response rate. Almost entirely "Causasian", basically from a population sample of British women. Not necessarily generalisable to other populations.},

  abstract      = {** Printed ** Background - Adult height has been inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk in several studies. The mechanism for this association is not well understood, however, and this was investigated by examining components of stature, cardiovascular disease risk factors and subsequent coronary heart disease in a prospective study. Methods - All men aged 45-59 years living in the town of Caerphilly, South Wales were approached, and 2512 (89%) responded and underwent a detailed examination, which included measurement of height and sitting height (from which an estimate of leg length was derived). Participants were followed up through repeat examinations and the cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease - both fatal and non-fatal - over a 15 year follow up period is the end point in this report. Results - Cross sectional associations between cardiovascular risk factors and components of stature (total height, leg length and trunk length) demonstrated that factors related to the insulin resistance syndrome - the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, fasting triglyceride levels and total to HDL cholesterol ratio - were less favourable in men with shorter legs, while showing reverse or no associations with trunk length. Fibrinogen levels were inversely associated with leg length and showed a weaker association with trunk length. Forced expiratory volume in one second was unrelated to leg length but strongly positively associated to trunk length. Other risk factors showed little association with components of stature. The risk of coronary heart disease was inversely related to leg length but showed little association with trunk length. Conclusions - Leg length is the component of stature related to insulin resistance and coronary heart disease risk. As leg length is unrelated to lung function measures it is unlikely that these can explain the association in this cohort. Factors that influence leg length in adulthood - including nutrition, other influences on growth in early life, genetic and epigenetic influences - merit further investigation in this regard. The reported associations suggest that pre-adult influences are important in the aetiology of coronary heart disease and insulin resistance.},

Leg and leg-trunk ratio inverse assoc with CHD risk. Leg assoc with insulin resistance, attenuated slightly after adjustment, but no longer significant, similar to leg-trunk ratio. Adjusted for BMI. Discussion: With age, disease may kill off shorter/short legged people, thus after certain age, leg and height may not be assoc with disease. Shrinkage occurs mostly in trunk*. Potential inhibition of fetal development may underlie lower height. But birthweight, indicator of fetal development, similarly related to leg and trunk*. Thus, leg indicates early childhood environment. Leg assoc with adult disease not appear to reflect confounding by SES. Leg may indicate early childhood environment, but later puberty results in even more leg-trunk ratio, so potentially leg and leg-trunk ratio may not be a great indicator of childhood conditions.

  abstract      = {** Printed ** The thrifty phenotype hypothesis proposes that the epidemiological associations between poor fetal and infant growth and the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome result from the effects of poor nutrition in early life, which produces permanent changes in glucose-insulin metabolism. These changes include reduced capacity for insulin secretion and insulin resistance which, combined with effects of obesity, ageing and physical inactivity, are the most important factors in determining type 2 diabetes. Since the hypothesis was proposed, many studies world-wide have confirmed the initial epidemiological evidence, although the strength of the relationships has varied from one study to another. The relationship with insulin resistance is clear at all ages studied. Less clear is the relationship with insulin secretion. The relative contribution of genes and environment to these relationships remains a matter of debate. The contributions of maternal hyperglycaemia and the trajectory of postnatal growth need to be clarified.},
  comment       = {Intro: Thrifty phenotype proposes that environmental factors are dominant cause of t2 diabetes. Poor development of pancreatic beta cell mass and function (islet of langerhans vasculature and possibly innveration) key elements linking poor early nutrition with diabetes. Fetal malnutrition led to IR. Altered growth permanently changes structure and function of body. Poor capacity for insulin secretion not bad for those who remain poorly nourished and thin. Gluc intolerance may be triggered by pos calorie balance. Key role of protein, but other nutrients important. Pathological changes from malnutrition as fetus only occur with other factors present, ie in an obesogenic environment. Effect of birth weight on diabetes risk is a continuum. In epidem, poor early growth assoc with IR, not insulin secretion. Obesity during childhood has greater impact on MetS than obesity in adulthood. Those who were small at birth, small up to age 7, but rapidly gained weight afterward were the most at risk of getting diabetes*. Accelerated weight gain had a greater impact on increased risk of diabetes among those who weighed 3000g or less at birth*. IR was assoc with thinness at birth, thinness at age 7 and overweight at adult*. Potential explanation is that fetal growth restriction may reduce pancreatic cell number and accelerated growth in childhood may place excessive demand on the small cell mass. Famine in holland during WW2 lead to IR with those born during the famine*. This famine was unique in that the famine was intense deprivation followed by nutrition restoration. In contrast, in Leningrad during the siege, nutrient intake was low, but following the siege, nutrient intake remained low. Therefore, there may not have been accelerated weight gain in the Russian childhood born during that time. Mothers diet can alter metabolism without altering birthweight. Early fetal famine exposure altered lipid metabolism, later fetal famine exposure altered gluc-insulin metabolism. Reduced maternal protein in animal models leads to similar phenotypes seen with MetS and diabetes in humans. In rats, protein restricted fetus's who had accelerated postnatal growth died young*. Those born to normal mothers but then suckled on a poor diet then weaned onto a normal diet did not have accelerated weight gain, but remained growth restricted*. Suckling may program appetite. Poorly nourished mother essentially gives a nutritional forecast to the fetus. The adaptations only become detrimental when postnatal environment is not as forecasted. Similar observations have been seen with cold exposure. Low maternal protein intake leads to incr hepatic gluconeogen, enhanced release of FA from intra-ab adipose tissue, resist to ketosis, incr express of insulin receptors with enhanced gluc uptake by adipose tissue*. These could be an advantage to those in poor nutrient envir. Discussion: Maternal nutrition provides a forecast to the fetus for the nutritional environment. When the forecast is wrong, adult disease can occur. IE: Poor fetal and childhood nutrition followed by accelerated weight gain in mid-to-late childhood leads to incr risk of diabetes. Limitations: Only looked at birthweight/weight, not stature.},

  abstract      = {** Printed ** Biomedical science has little considered the relevance of life history theory and evolutionary and ecological developmental biology to clinical medicine. However, the observations that early life influences can alter later disease risk - the "developmental origins of health and disease" (DOHaD) paradigm - have led to a recognition that these perspectives can inform our understanding of human biology. We propose that the DOHaD phenomenon can be considered as a subset of the broader processes of developmental plasticity by which organisms adapt to their environment during their life course. Such adaptive processes allow genotypic variation to be preserved through transient environmental changes. Cues for plasticity operate particularly during early development; they may affect a single organ or system, but generally they induce integrated adjustments in the mature phenotype, a process underpinned by epigenetic mechanisms and influenced by prediction of the mature environment. In mammals, an adverse intrauterine environment results in an integrated suite of responses, suggesting the involvement of a few key regulatory genes, that resets the developmental trajectory in expectation of poor postnatal conditions. Mismatch between the anticipated and the actual mature environment exposes the organism to risk of adverse consequences - the greater the mismatch, the greater the risk. For humans, prediction is inaccurate for many individuals because of changes in the postnatal environment toward energy-dense nutrition and low energy expenditure, contributing to the epidemic of chronic noncommunicable disease. This view of human disease from the perspectives of life history biology and evolutionary theory offers new approaches to prevention, diagnosis and intervention. {\copyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
  comment       = {Intro: Developmental origins of health and disease (DOHD) represents the fundamental processes of developmental plasticity, which mammals adjust their life history strategy in response to environmental cues during early development. Adult organism would be suited to environment it adjusts to, but if the environment is different, health may be compromised. Offspring of those in the dutch famine did not have reduced birthweight, but did have incr risk of obesity*. Genetic variation will play a role in determining sensitivity to envir stimuli. Fetus adapts to maternal undernourishment by growth retardation, becoming better equipped to deal with deficient environment. This reduced growth probably occurs through decr insulin sensitivity. However, this change in insulin sensitivity only has consequences later in life. Intrauterine growth restriction and mild prematurity may be immediately advantageous adaptations. Reduced growth likely caused by reduced nutritional supply from mother. Fetus responds by reducing anabolic demand by reducing plasma insulin and plasma and tissue IGF1 (two of best documented growth promoters*). Redistribution of fetal blood to develop critical organs. Small birth higher risk of neonatal death. Prematurity similar to IUGR in that a poor or hazardous maternal environment may prompt the fetus to being born early to escape abnormal intrauterine environment, with incr risk of postnatal morbidity and mortality*. Predictive adaptive responses. Animals born early in the summer undergo rapid growth to breed early, those born later are growth restricted and overwinter as prepubertal animals of subadult size. Predictive adaptive hypothesis states that the maternal environment predicts the environment outside of the womb and the fetus adapts to be best suit to the environment, but when a mismatch occurs, later health consequences may occur. This PAH hypothesis may be the result of epigenetics. This phenomenon may be more of a physiological plasticity rather than pathology. This hypothesis allows changes to occur faster than classical genetics would allow. Fetal nutrition not the same as maternal dietary intake. Fetal nutrition depends on her energy expenditure, her nutritional environment, her behaviour, her metabolic and cardiovascular function, placental health and function, and fetal endocrine status. Maternal constraint - nongenetic characteristics that limit fetal growth. IE: size of fetus dependent on size of mother. Evidence that shows that mothers have receptors in placenta that clear fetal IGF*. Non-genetic factors (including maternal constraint) account for 50% of the variance of birth size. Maternal height and pelvic size are tightly correlated, thus maternal constraint is key to limiting fetal growth and allowing successful reproduction. Also, PAH states that maternal constraint includes nutrient allocation by the pregnant mother and environmental stressors that the mother may face. Greater the mismatch, the greater the risk of disease. Can be applied to rapidly developing nations. Developmental plasticity acts to incr phenotypic variation, allowing shift in positioning of individuals physiology within reaction norm to optimize its phenotype for a particular environment and incre its fitness (survival & reproductive). Life-history theory based on consideration of optimal allocation of resources to somatic effort and reproductive effort to maximize reproductive fitness. Those born smaller are essentially diverting their resources away from somatic (growth and maintenance) efforts to reproductive efforts, thus having a propensity to die at a younger age*. This diverting of resources is likely to result in removing of redundancies, such as reduced nephron number*, or fewer neurons in some areas of the brain*. The fetus predicts a shorter life, so invests less in musculoskeletal growth and having the propensity to store fat and for peripheral IR (both seen in humans)*. Good nutrition during childhood leads to early puberty, likewise, LBW accelerates sexual maturation if postnatal nutrition allows*. This is similar to antagonistic pleitropy (genes giving benefit to early life but harmful effects later in life will be selected for because of the reproductive advantage)*. IR does not appear until well after birth in small for gestational age babies*. During human evolution, this forecasting might have been very advantageous to the individual, however in the current global environment when changes occurs very quickly, the forecasting may actually be of harm to the individual. As a result, we are still impacted by maternal constraint even though the nutritional environment is becoming increasingly enriched in developed and recented developed countries.

Although evidence is accumulating, little is known regarding the impact of poor early-life conditions on older adult (50 years and older) health in these settings. A systematic review of 1141 empirical studies was conducted to identify population-based and community studies in low- and middle-income countries, which examined associations between early-life conditions and older adult health. The resulting review of 20 studies revealed strong associations between (1) in utero/early infancy exposures (independent of other early life and adult conditions) and adult heart disease and diabetes; (2) poor nutrition during childhood and difficulties in adult cognition and diabetes; (3) specific childhood illnesses such as rheumatic fever and malaria and adult heart disease and mortality; (4) poor childhood health and adult functionality/disability and chronic diseases; (5) poor childhood socioeconomic status ({SES)} and adult mortality, functionality/disability and cognition; and (6) parental survival during childhood and adult functionality/disability and cognition. In several instances, associations remained strong even after controlling for adult {SES} and lifestyle. Although exact mechanisms cannot be identified, these studies reinforce to some extent the importance of early-life environment on health at older ages. Given the paucity of cohort data from the developing world to examine hypotheses of early-life conditions and older adult health, population-based studies are relevant in providing a broad perspective on the origins of adult health.},

Methods: Cross-sectional data on height and sitting height were collected from 14 500 children of Dutch origin in the age range 0-21 years. Reference SD charts were constructed by the LMS method. Correlations were analysed in three age groups. SH/H data from patients with Marfan syndrome and genetically confirmed hypochondroplasia were compared with height corrected SH/H references. Results: A positive association was observed between H SDS, SH SDS, and LL SDS in all age groups. There was a negative correlation between SH/H SDS and height SDS. In short children with a height SDS <-2 SDS, a cut-off limit of +2.5 SD leads to a more acceptable percentage of false positive results. In exceptionally tall children, a cut-off limit of -2.2 SDS can be used. Alternatively, a nomogram of SH/H SDS versus H SDS can be helpful. The sensitivity of the height corrected cut-off lines for hypochondroplasia was 80% and for Marfan syndrome only 30%. Conclusions: In exceptionally short or tall children, the dependency of the SH/H ratio (SDS) on height SDS has to be taken into consideration in the evaluation of body proportions.

  abstract   = {** Printed ** A slow rate of intrauterine growth is a major risk factor for several common noncommunicable diseases, which include the following: coronary heart disease {(CHD)}, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Likewise, growth patterns in infancy and childhood have been identified as important factors linked to the pathogenesis of these disorders. In this overview, patterns of growth associated with {CHD}, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic traits in adult life are presented on the basis of findings from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study {(HBCS)} 1934 to 1944. Later risk of {CHD} was associated with small body size at birth and during infancy, followed by an increase in body size later in childhood. This pattern of growth has been associated with dyslipidemia in later life, which offers an explanation for the observed findings. Type 2 diabetes and {CHD} share several risk factors. The early growth of persons who later develop type 2 diabetes includes a small body size at birth as well as a small body size during infancy. An early age at adiposity rebound was associated with a markedly increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. The patterns of growth associated with type 2 diabetes are also associated with alterations in body composition, which predisposes to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. The presented findings suggest that to be able to understand the pathogenesis of several noncommunicable diseases, the diseases need to be studied from a life-course perspective, and prenatal and childhood growth as well as adult characteristics need to be taken into account.},

Results/Discussion: CHD - low weight at 1y increased CHD risk, independent of birthweight. Those with lowest birthweight and lowest BMI at 2y had greatest risk. Those with the lowest BMi at 2y but the highest BMI at 11y had greatest risk. Small at birth, small in infancy, large in later childhood highest risk. Small birthweight, plus slow growth during infancy has poor liver growth, seen in this cohort with subjects who took lipid lowering drugs had the lowest BMI at birth. Diabetes - small at birth incr risk of diabetes, IR, insulin secretion. Growth pattern similar to CHD. Higher incidence in those who had the weight rebound before 5y compared to having the weight rebound after 7y. Mechanism for the weight rebound is unknown. Early growth and body composition - low birthweight and low weight in infancy assoc with lower muscle mass. Fat mass and fat distribution were not consistently assoc with birthweight. Adult lean BMI positively assoc with more rapid gain in BMI from birth to 11y. Rapid gain til 2y increased adult lean mass but not fat accumulation. Rapid gain later in childhood had increase lean mass but also a greater increase in fat mass.},

Famine exposure groups were defined as nonexposed; fetal exposed; and early childhood, midchildhood, or late childhood exposed. Excess death rate was used to determine the severity of the famine. The {ATP} {III} criteria were used for the definition of metabolic syndrome (three or more of the following variables: elevated fasting triglyceride levels, lower {HDL} cholesterol levels, elevated fasting glucose levels, higher waist circumference, high blood pressure). {RESULTS} In severely affected famine areas, adults who were exposed to the famine during fetal life had a higher risk of metabolic syndrome, as compared with nonexposed subjects (odds ratio 3.13 [95\% {CI} 1.24-7.89, P = 0.016]). Similar associations were observed among adults who were exposed to the famine during early childhood, but not for adults exposed to the famine during mid- or late childhood. Participants who were born in severely affected famine areas and had Western dietary habits in adulthood or were overweight in adulthood had a particularly high risk of metabolic syndrome in later life. {CONCLUSIONS} Exposure to the Chinese famine during fetal life or infancy is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome in adulthood. These associations are stronger among subjects with a Western dietary pattern or who were overweight in adulthood.},

We investigated (1) whether taller childhood stature predicts longer adult leg than trunk length; (2) the effects of early life factors on adult leg/trunk length. Methods: We used data from the 1958 British birth cohort on height in childhood and at 45 years, leg and trunk length at 45 years and early life factors (n $\approx$ 5,900). Results: For a SD increase in height at 7 years, adult leg length increased more than trunk length (2.5-2.8 cm vs. 1.9 cm). Parental height had a stronger association with adult than childhood height, and leg than trunk length. Prenatal factors were associated with leg (maternal smoking) and trunk length (birth order); birth weight had a similar effect on leg and trunk lengths. Large family size, overcrowding, and social housing were more strongly associated with leg than trunk length: deficits in adult height (0.4-0.8 cm) were mostly due to shorter legs. Conclusions: Socio-economic adversity in childhood is associated with delayed early growth, shorter adult leg length, and stature. Leg length is the height component most sensitive to early environment.

Height measured at 7, 11, 16, 33 and 42. At 45, leg length measured as well as height. Difference between 33 and 45 neglible, except for 30 individuals. Used 33 yrs as adult height, for all the rest is 45 yrs. Mothers height was recorded in 1958. Fathers height taken in 1969. Birthweight measured, birth order, maternal smoking. Infant feeding, social class, based on occupation of male head of household, nonmanual or manual. Large families >= 3, overcrowding >=1.5/rm, housing status renting/own or social housing. Divorce at age 7 recorded at 33 yrs from cohort members. Height, leg and trunk converted to sex-specific SD. Multivariate models, linear regression. Height at 7 was chosen as it is a measure of pre-pubertal growth when early environment is most influential. Adjusted for parental height, family size, birthweight, social class. For leg length, adjusted for trunk, vice versa. Male and female were combined, but adjusted by gender. leg and trunk measures available for 8,903. Results: Coefficient of variation was 5.6% for leg and 4.1% for trunk. Leg more correlated to height than trunk (r=0.83 & 0.85, m & f, r=0.73 & 0.76). Prepubertal height most strongly assoc with adult leg (P<0.001). Parental height more strongly associated with adult height than height at 7, and with adult leg than with trunk. Birthweight stronger assoc with adult then child height, similarly to leg and trunk. Birth order and maternal smoking stronger assoc with child height than adult. Later-born children were shorter in both child and adult heights. Maternal smoking = shorter offspring at child and adult ages: deficit in height entirely due to legs. Family size, overcrowding, housing tenure stronger influence on child height than on adult. Larger families, overcrowding, social housing = much shorter at 7 and shorter at adult, both height and leg more so than trunk. Breast feeding, social class, parental divorce not assoc with height after adjustment. Discussion: Taller prepubertal stature is assoc with longer legs than trunk in adulthood. Postnatal factors, ie: overcrowding, almost entirely due to leg (shorter in overcrowding). Parental height and birthweight more strongly assoc with adult than child height and parental height only with leg. Greater leg and trunk length assoc with advantaged circumstances. Leg length more sensitive to early life influences, such as family size, overcrowding, social housing. Prenatal growth affects height, but not necessarily components of height. Parental height strongly assoc with adult leg than turnk, potential intergenerational effect. Limitations: Childhood height components not recorded. Potential shrinkage due to age.

  abstract  = {** Full Text** Associations of birthweight with leg length and trunk length are similar. Childhood exposures rather than in-utero programming may underlie specific associations seen between leg length and mortality. In-utero programming of the body's structure and metabolism plays an important role in influencing the risk of adult chronic disease.1 It is argued that programming may occur in early development and, by implication, exposures operating in childhood are of less importance.1 The alternative life-course model of adult chronic disease development proposes that exposures acting throughout both early and later life are important in influencing later disease risk.2 Intraut erine programming and life-course models generate different predictions about the expected relative strength of associations between adult diseases and variables that act as proxies for fetal or childhood environments. Birthweight is often taken as a proxy for fetal nutrition. Leg length has been used as a proxy for childhood nutrition as it is the component of stature most sensitive to the childhood environment.3 Associations between leg length and adult mortality from cancer and coronary heart disease are seen in analyses of the Boyd Orr cohort and NHANES data, [3] and [4] implying that childhood influences are of importance. However these associations may have arisen through in-utero programming of childhood growth hormone and other growth-regulating factors, and so the exposure proxy---leg length---and disease outcome are both determined by the intrauterine environment.1 To test whether leg length (as a marker of the childhood environment) is independent of birthweight, we examined associations between birthweight and the two components of stature: leg length and trunk length. If leg length is programmed by nutrition in utero we would expect that associations between birthweight and leg length would be stronger than those between trunk length and birthweight. We analysed four studies: the Boyd Orr cohort where data on birthweight and both childhood height and leg length are available for 232 children; Low's data from a longitudinal study of 126 Aberdeen boys and girls measured regularly from birth (3 days post-partum) up to the age of 5 years;5 the Caerphilly cohort where data on self-reported birthweight and measured adult sitting height are available for 1224 people; and the Midspan Family Study based on recorded birthweight and stature at ages 30--59 (n=675) (table). There is no consistent evidence that birthweight is more strongly related to leg length than trunk length. Furthermore, in multivariate regression models we found no significant differences between birthweight and leg-length; and birthweight and trunk-length associations. Birthweight is a relatively insensitive measure of nutrition in utero as it takes no account of overall size at birth. In Low's data, we calculated partial correlation coefficients of birthweight with leg length and trunk length adjusted for length at 3 days of age, thus giving a measure of nutrition in utero which is relatively independent of size at birth. The partial correlation coefficients between leg length and birthweight, adjusted for birth length, were -0$\cdot$05 and -0$\cdot$21 in males and females respectively. For trunk length the partial correlations were 0$\cdot$08 and -0$\cdot$04 respectively. These data indicate that childhood leg length is no more strongly related to anthropometric indicators of nutrition in utero than is trunk length. Conversely, the associations of childhood and adult stature with adult disease risk seem to be specific to leg length. [3] and [4] This suggests that leg length is a marker for childhood rather than pre-natal exposures in these studies. Mechanisms linking prenatal and early life exposures to adult diseases remain uncertain. However, these data indicate that exposures operating in childhood also contribute to the predisposition to disease in adulthood.},

We argue that a formal causal framework can help in designing a statistical analysis that comes as close as possible to answering the motivating causal question, while making clear what assumptions are required to endow the resulting estimates with a causal interpretation. A systematic approach for the integration of causal modeling with statistical estimation is presented. We highlight some common points of confusion that occur when causal modeling techniques are applied in practice and provide a broad overview on the types of questions that a causal framework can help to address. Our aims are to argue for the utility of formal causal thinking, to clarify what causal models can and cannot do, and to provide an accessible introduction to the flexible and powerful tools provided by causal models.},

  abstract    = {In respiratory health research, interest often lies in estimating the effect of an exposure on a health outcome. If randomization of the exposure of interest is not possible, estimating its effect is typically complicated by confounding bias. This can often be dealt with by controlling for the variables causing the confounding, if measured, in the statistical analysis. Common statistical methods used to achieve this include multivariable regression models adjusting for selected confounding variables or stratification on those variables. Therefore, a key question is which measured variables need to be controlled for in order to remove confounding. An approach to confounder-selection based on the use of causal diagrams (often called directed acyclic graphs) is discussed. A causal diagram is a visual representation of the causal relationships believed to exist between the variables of interest, including the exposure, outcome and potential confounding variables. After creating a causal diagram for the research question, an intuitive and easy-to-use set of rules can be applied, based on a foundation of rigorous mathematics, to decide which measured variables must be controlled for in the statistical analysis in order to remove confounding, to the extent that is possible using the available data. This approach is illustrated by constructing a causal diagram for the research question: 'Does personal smoking affect the risk of subsequent asthma?'. Using data taken from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, the statistical analysis suggested by the causal diagram approach was performed.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments--the use of "negative controls"--is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

  abstract    = {This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.},

However, once one has algebraically identified effect modifiers, the DAG implies a role for them. The limitations of epidemiologic definitions of "effect modification" are discussed, along with the implications of scale dependency for assessing interactions, where the scale can be either absolute risk, relative risk, or odds. My view is that probabilistic independence leads to the log-complement as a natural scale for interaction, but even that scale does not necessarily admit unambiguous inference. Any 2 direct causes of D are effect modifiers for each other on at least 2 scales, which can make a reasonable person question the utility of the concept. Still, etiologic models for joint effects are important, because most diseases arise through pathways involving multiple factors. I suggest an enhancement in construction of DAGs in epidemiology that includes arrow-on-arrow representations for effect modification. Examples are given, some of which depend on scale and some of which do not. An example illustrates possible biologic implications for such an effect modification DAG.},

However, observational research is often the only alternative for causal inference. This article reviews a condition that permits the estimation of causal effects from observational data, and two methods -- standardisation and inverse probability weighting -- to estimate population causal effects under that condition. For simplicity, the main description is restricted to dichotomous variables and assumes that no random error attributable to sampling variability exists. The appendix provides a generalisation of inverse probability weighting.},

  abstract    = {Within the fields of epidemiology, interventions research and social sciences researchers are often faced with the challenge of decomposing the effect of an exposure into different causal pathways working through defined mediator variables. The goal of such analyses is often to understand the mechanisms of the system or to suggest possible interventions. The case of a single mediator, thus implying only 2 causal pathways (direct and indirect) from exposure to outcome, has been extensively studied. By using the framework of counterfactual variables, researchers have established theoretical properties and developed powerful tools. However, in practical problems, it is not uncommon to have several distinct causal pathways from exposure to outcome operating through different mediators. In this article, we suggest a widely applicable approach to quantifying and ranking different causal pathways. The approach is an extension of the natural effect models proposed by Lange et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(3):190-195). By allowing the analysis of distinct multiple pathways, the suggested approach adds to the capabilities of modern mediation techniques. Furthermore, the approach can be implemented using standard software, and we have included with this article implementation examples using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Stata software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).},

This problem is particularly acute in computationally intensive domains where results rely on a series of complex methodological decisions that are not well captured by traditional publication approaches. Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but practical implementation of these practices remains difficult. This is because reproducing published computational analyses requires installing many software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into the complete pipeline, and specifying parameters. Here we present a suite of recently emerged technologies which make computational reproducibility not just possible, but, finally, practical in both time and effort. By combining a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and an integrated workflow system that automatically orchestrates the composition of these packages for entire pipelines, an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility can be achieved.},

Adequately powered studies with prospective, unbiased, standardised assessment of key behavioural factors for gene-lifestyle studies are lacking. This case-cohort study aims to investigate how genetic and potentially modifiable lifestyle and behavioural factors, particularly diet and physical activity, interact in their influence on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Incident cases of type 2 diabetes occurring in European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohorts between 1991 and 2007 from eight of the ten EPIC countries were ascertained and verified. Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random-effects meta-analyses were used to investigate differences in diabetes incidence by age and sex. A total of 12,403 verified incident cases of type 2 diabetes occurred during 3.99 million person-years of follow-up of 340,234 EPIC participants eligible for InterAct. We defined a centre-stratified subcohort of 16,154 individuals for comparative analyses. Individuals with incident diabetes who were randomly selected into the subcohort (n = 778) were included as cases in the analyses. All prevalent diabetes cases were excluded from the study. InterAct cases were followed-up for an average of 6.9 years; 49.7% were men. Mean baseline age and age at diagnosis were 55.6 and 62.5 years, mean BMI and waist circumference values were 29.4 kg/m(2) and 102.7 cm in men, and 30.1 kg/m(2) and 92.8 cm in women, respectively. Risk of type 2 diabetes increased linearly with age, with an overall HR of 1.56 (95% CI 1.48-1.64) for a 10 year age difference, adjusted for sex. A male excess in the risk of incident diabetes was consistently observed across all countries, with a pooled HR of 1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.64), adjusted for age. InterAct is a large, well-powered, prospective study that will inform our understanding of the interplay between genes and lifestyle factors on the risk of type 2 diabetes development.},

  title     = {Linking Whole-grain Bread, Coffee, and Red Meat to the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes},
  school    = {Universit{\"a}t Potsdam},
  year      = {2017},
  abstract  = {Background: Consumption of whole-grain, coffee, and red meat were consistently related to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in prospective cohort studies, but potentially underlying biological mechanisms are not well understood. Metabolomics profiles were shown to be sensitive to these dietary exposures, and at the same time to be informative with respect to the risk of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, graphical network-models were demonstrated to reflect the biological processes underlying high-dimensional metabolomics profiles. Aim: The aim of this study was to infer hypotheses on the biological mechanisms that link consumption of whole-grain bread, coffee, and red meat, respectively, to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. More specifically, it was aimed to consider network models of amino acid and lipid profiles as potential mediators of these risk-relations. Study population: Analyses were conducted in the prospective EPIC-Potsdam cohort (n = 27,548), applying a nested case-cohort design (n = 2731, including 692 incident diabetes cases). Habitual diet was assessed with validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaires. Concentrations of 126 metabolites (acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, amino acids) were determined in baseline-serum samples. Incident type 2 diabetes cases were assed and validated in an active follow-up procedure. The median follow-up time was 6.6 years. Analytical design: The methodological approach was conceptually based on counterfactual causal inference theory. Observations on the network-encoded conditional independence structure restricted the space of possible causal explanations of observed metabolomics-data patterns. Given basic directionality assumptions (diet affects metabolism; metabolism affects future diabetes incidence), adjustment for a subset of direct neighbours was sufficient to consistently estimate network-independent direct effects. Further model-specification, however, was limited due to missing directionality information on the links between metabolites. Therefore, a multi-model approach was applied to infer the bounds of possible direct effects. All metabolite-exposure links and metabolite-outcome links, respectively, were classified into one of three categories: direct effect, ambiguous (some models indicated an effect others not), and no-effect. Cross-sectional and longitudinal relations were evaluated in multivariable-adjusted linear regression and Cox proportional hazard regression models, respectively. Models were comprehensively adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, prevalence of hypertension, dietary and lifestyle factors, and medication. Results: Consumption of whole-grain bread was related to lower levels of several lipid metabolites with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Coffee was related to lower aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, and had potential effects on the fatty acid profile within lipid classes. Red meat was linked to lower glycine levels and was related to higher circulating concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. In addition, potential marked effects of red meat consumption on the fatty acid composition within the investigated lipid classes were identified. Moreover, potential beneficial and adverse direct effects of metabolites on type 2 diabetes risk were detected. Aromatic amino acids and lipid metabolites with even-chain saturated (C14-C18) and with specific polyunsaturated fatty acids had adverse effects on type 2 diabetes risk. Glycine, glutamine, and lipid metabolites with monounsaturated fatty acids and with other species of polyunsaturated fatty acids were classified as having direct beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes risk. Potential mediators of the diet-diabetes links were identified by graphically overlaying this information in network models. Mediation analyses revealed that effects on lipid metabolites could potentially explain about one fourth of the whole-grain bread effect on type 2 diabetes risk; and that effects of coffee and red meat consumption on amino acid and lipid profiles could potentially explain about two thirds of the altered type 2 diabetes risk linked to these dietary exposures. Conclusion: An algorithm was developed that is capable to integrate single external variables (continuous exposures, survival time) and high-dimensional metabolomics-data in a joint graphical model. Application to the EPIC-Potsdam cohort study revealed that the observed conditional independence patterns were consistent with the a priori mediation hypothesis: Early effects on lipid and amino acid metabolism had the potential to explain large parts of the link between three of the most widely discussed diabetes-related dietary exposures and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract        = {Since the year 2000, IDF has been measuring the prevalence of diabetes nationally, regionally and globally. To produce estimates of the global burden of diabetes and its impact for 2017 and projections for 2045. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published studies on the prevalence of diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance and hyperglycaemia in pregnancy in the period from 1990 to 2016. The highest quality studies on diabetes prevalence were selected for each country. A logistic regression model was used to generate age-specific prevalence estimates or each country. Estimates for countries without data were extrapolated from similar countries. It was estimated that in 2017 there are 451 million (age 18-99 years) people with diabetes worldwide. These figures were expected to increase to 693 million) by 2045. It was estimated that almost half of all people (49.7%) living with diabetes are undiagnosed. Moreover, there was an estimated 374 million people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and it was projected that almost 21.3 million live births to women were affected by some form of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. In 2017, approximately 5 million deaths worldwide were attributable to diabetes in the 20-99 years age range. The global healthcare expenditure on people with diabetes was estimated to be USD 850 billion in 2017. The new estimates of diabetes prevalence, deaths attributable to diabetes and healthcare expenditure due to diabetes present a large social, financial and health system burden across the world.},

  abstract      = {Objectives Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is consistently associated with poor health, yet little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this inequality. In children, we examined the impact of early-life SES trajectories on the intensity of global innate immune activation, recognizing that excessive activation can be a precursor to inflammation and chronic disease. Methods Stimulated interleukin-6 production, a measure of immune responsiveness, was analyzed ex vivo for 267 Canadian schoolchildren from a 1995 birth cohort in Manitoba, Canada. Childhood SES trajectories were determined from parent-reported housing data using a longitudinal latent-class modeling technique. Multivariate regression was conducted with adjustment for potential confounders. Results SES was inversely associated with innate immune responsiveness (p = 0.003), with persistently low-SES children exhibiting responses more than twice as intense as their high-SES counterparts. Despite initially lower SES, responses from children experiencing increasing SES trajectories throughout childhood were indistinguishable from high-SES children. Low-SES effects were strongest among overweight children (p<0.01). Independent of SES trajectories, immune responsiveness was increased in First Nations children (p<0.05) and urban children with atopic asthma (p<0.01). Conclusions These results implicate differential immune activation in the association between SES and clinical outcomes, and broadly imply that SES interventions during childhood could limit or reverse the damaging biological effects of exposure to poverty during the preschool years.},
  comment       = {Methods: In Manitoba, Canada. Nest case-control of 267 children. Blood samples of some children for IL-6. Childhood SES was determined by asking parents the number of bedrooms were present in each year of a child's life, which is a proxy for SES. Because housing is more accurately recalled than income.

  abstract      = {{Background/Objectives:} To determine whether exposure to the Chinese famine during fetal life and early childhood was associated with a greater risk of metabolic syndrome in later life. {Subjects/Methods:} We used data of adults from the 2008 annual physical examinations in Public Health Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in Chongqing. To minimize misclassification of the famine exposure periods, subjects born in 1959 and 1962 were excluded. Totally, 5040 participants were enrolled and categorized into control (1963{\^{a}}``1964), fetally exposed (1960{\^{a}}``1961) and postnatally exposed (1957{\^{a}}``1958) group. We adopted the definition of metabolic syndrome recommended by the Chinese Diabetes Society in 2004. Results: Women in fetally and postnatally exposed groups had significantly higher prevalences of metabolic syndrome than in control group (7.3\% and 8.6\% vs 4.0\%, P{\textless}0.05, respectively). Women in fetally and postnatally exposed groups had a significantly higher risk of metabolic syndrome, as compared with control women (odds ratio {(OR)} 1.87 (95\% confidence interval {(CI)} 1.15{\^{a}}``3.04, P=0.012), {OR} 1.50 (95\% {CI} 1.20{\^{a}}``1.87, P=0.0003), respectively). Similar association was not observed among men. The prevalences of metabolic syndrome among men in control, fetally and postnatally exposed groups were 20.1\%, 22.5\% and 18.8\%, respectively, but there was no significant difference of prevalences among the three groups. Conclusions: We found that exposure to the Chinese famine in early life period was associated with higher risk of metabolic syndrome in adulthood of women, but not men. This gender difference might be due to the mortality selection and son preference hypothesis.},
  comment       = {Methods: Urban Chinese born near the Chinese famine. Used data from subjects of annual physical exams. Participants were born around the time of the famine. Participants were split into three birth cohorts. Those conceived after the famine (no intrauterine or postnatal exposure), those born at the end of the famine (intrauterine exposure), and those born at the start of the famine (postnatal). Fasting blood sample collected. MetS definition using Chinese diabetes society with BMI, TAG, HDL, blood pressure, and fasting glucose. 3 or more classified as MetS. n=5040. Results: Men exposed postnatally were more hypertensive and dysglycemic, men exposed fetally were dysglycemic. Females exposed postnatally were more obese, high TAG, high blood pressure, and high blood glucose. Females exposed fetally had high TAG, blood pressure, and glucose. Many more men had the MetS, however, no significant OR found for exposure to famine. Females who were exposed both fetally and postnatally to the famine had a greater OR for the MEtS. Discussion: Two possible reasons why males are not affected. One, mortality selection, where male infant mortality is much higher than female mortality, and the males that ssurvive are the healthier portion of the population. Two, the son preference in China, given the discrimination against daughters, more food might be given to the sons rather than the daughters.},

  abstract      = {Evidence is lacking on whether the duration and timing of low socioeconomic position (SEP) across a person's life course may be associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The authors{\textquoteright} objectives were to investigate associations between cumulative SEP and the incidence of T2D in the Framingham Offspring Study (n = 1,893; 52% women; mean baseline age = 34 years). Pooled logistic regression analyses demonstrated that age-adjusted cumulative SEP was associated with T2D in women (for low vs. high cumulative SEP, odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 3.42). Age-adjusted analyses for young-adulthood SEP (7.85 for $\leq$12 vs. >16 years of education, OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.03), active professional life SEP (for laborer vs. professional/executive/supervisory/technical occupations, OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.05, 5.47), and social-mobility frameworks (for declining life-course SEP, OR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.39, 6.44; for stable low vs. stable high life-course SEP, OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.02, 3.35) all demonstrated associations between low SEP and T2D incidence in women. No association was observed between childhood SEP and T2D in women for father's education (some high school or less vs. any postsecondary education, OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.72, 2.22). In men, there was little evidence of associations between life-course SEP and T2D incidence. These findings suggest that cumulative SEP is inversely associated with incidence of T2D in women, and that this association may be primarily due to the women's educational levels and occupations.},

  abstract      = {Context: Early postnatal life has been suggested as an important window during which risks for long-term health may be influenced. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the independent associations between weight gain during infancy (0{\^{a}}``6 months) and early childhood (3{\^{a}}``6 yr) with components of the metabolic syndrome in young adults. Design: This was a prospective cohort study {(The} Stockholm Weight Development Study). Setting: The study was conducted in a general community. Participants: Subjects included 128 (54 males) singletons, followed from birth to 17 yr. Main Outcome Measure: None of these young adults met the full criteria for the metabolic syndrome. We therefore calculated a continuous clustered metabolic risk score by averaging the standardized values of the following components: waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and insulin level. Results: Clustered metabolic risk at age 17 yr was predicted by weight gain during infancy (standardized {\^{I}}\textsuperscript{2} = 0.16; P {\textless} 0.0001) but not during early childhood (standardized {\^{I}}\textsuperscript{2} = 0.10; P = 0.23), adjusted for birth weight, gestational age, current height, maternal fat mass, and socioeconomic status at age 17 yr. Further adjustment for current fat mass and weight gain during childhood did not alter the significant association between infancy weight gain with the metabolic risk score (standardized {\^{I}}\textsuperscript{2} = 0.20; P = 0.007). Conclusions: Rapid weight gain during infancy (0{\^{a}}``6 months) but not during early childhood (3{\^{a}}``6 yr) predicted clustered metabolic risk at age 17 yr. Early interventions to moderate rapid weight gain even at very young ages may help to reduce adult cardiovascular disease risks.},
