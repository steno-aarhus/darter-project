## Abstract

Early life adversity is known to influence the risk for adult cardiometabolic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, how metabolic processes mediate
this link is unknown. Two recent
advances have removed some of the historical barriers to research in this field (i.e.
difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data). First is the ability to link
cohort studies (with metabolic data) to national register databases (with
demographic and medical data). Second is the emergence of mediation analysis and
causal structure learning techniques
that allow us to identify how early life adversity may contribute to adult
metabolism and to T2D risk. My aims are to 1) understand how specific early life
conditions affect T2D risk, 2) identify the metabolic pathways that mediate
between early life adversity and adult T2D risk, and 3) to develop a recent
causal pathway algorithm (NetCoupler) capable of performing mediation and causal
structure analysis on detailed metabolic data into a reusable
software package. To achieve these aims, I will a) use Denmark's unique national
registers linked with multiple cohorts, b) deploy and apply NetCoupler, and c)
collaborate with national and international groups. The software will provide a
tool for researchers working in similar areas, while the results will give
insight into how more effective public health strategies could be created for
T2D prevention and how more precise clinical decisions could be made for T2D
management in those exposed to early life adversity.
