# Study Protocol

## Abstract

Early life adversity is known to influence the risk for adult cardiometabolic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, how metabolic processes mediate
this link is unknown. Two recent
advances have removed some of the historical barriers to research in this field (i.e.
difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data). First is the ability to link
cohort studies (with metabolic data) to national register databases (with
demographic and medical data). Second is the emergence of mediation analysis and
causal structure learning techniques
that allow us to identify how early life adversity may contribute to adult
metabolism and to T2D risk. My aims are to 1) understand how specific early life
conditions affect T2D risk, 2) identify the metabolic pathways that mediate
between early life adversity and adult T2D risk, and 3) to develop a recent
causal pathway algorithm (NetCoupler) capable of performing mediation and causal
structure analysis on detailed metabolic data into a reusable
software package. To achieve these aims, I will a) use Denmark's unique national
registers linked with multiple cohorts, b) deploy and apply NetCoupler, and c)
collaborate with national and international groups. The software will provide a
tool for researchers working in similar areas, while the results will give
insight into how more effective public health strategies could be created for
T2D prevention and how more precise clinical decisions could be made for T2D
management in those exposed to early life adversity.

## Background and rationale

Early life adversity is known to influence the risk for chronic cardiometabolic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) in later adulthood. Early life, typically
defined from conception until early childhood (~6 years), is a period
characterised by substantial growth and development that can establish an
individual's metabolic capacity for the rest of their life
[@Hales2001;@Gluckman2007]. Extreme periods of or consistent exposure to
adversity, such as poverty, malnutrition, or famine, can set individuals on a
higher disease risk trajectory
[@Hales2001;@Li2011a;@Clarkin2012;@McEniry2013;@Berens2017a]. For instance,
exposure to famine during early life can increase the risk of developing T2D by
about 60% [@Abeelen2012a]. While extreme early life adversity is relatively
uncommon in contemporary European populations, some immigrants and refugees have
been exposed to more extreme conditions (e.g. refugees from conflict-ridden
Syria). Even less extreme adversity, such as neglect, loss of a parent, or
childhood conflict, can increase the risk for diseases such as T2D
[@Maniam2014a]. For instance, neglect and emotional abuse can increase the risk
of obesity, a strong determinant of T2D, by up to 50% [@Thomas2008a]. These forms
of adversity are much more common in many EU countries, with nearly 30% of EU
children experiencing some form of mental or physical abuse [@Europe2014a].

Much of the literature on early life origins of disease come from a few birth cohorts
[@Solis2016a;@Whitley2008a;@Skidmore2007;@Eriksson2011;@Ekelund2007a;@Azad2012a;@Chaparro2014a]
or is based on inferences from cross-sectional studies, animal models, or "natural"
experiments (e.g the Dutch Hunger Winter, a period of famine during the Nazi
occupation of the Netherlands)
[@Schulz2010a;@Zheng2012a;@Carroll2013a;@Han2015a]. However, limited studies
have investigated how early life adversity mediates its influence on later
disease through adult metabolic capacity (such as through lipid metabolism,
inflammatory processes, and/or glucose regulation; hypothetical pathways are
shown in Figure 1) [@Berens2017a]. A key component to efficient identification,
prevention, and management of T2D risk is knowledge on these specific mechanisms
involved in the pathogenesis of T2D and which mechanism to target to mitigate
risk. The few studies on this topic, mainly cross-sectional and/or self-report
of early life, have found that early life socioeconomic position and childhood
experiences such as neglect associate with a lower composite score of metabolic
capacity [@Solis2016a;@Solis2015a;@Robertson2014a;@Kumari2012a;@Gruenewald2012a].

The increasing availability of "big data" offers powerful alternatives to costly
birth cohorts and can fill important knowledge gaps. For example, in the
Scandinavian countries a wide range of medical and socioeconomic data has been
recorded in national citizen registry databases over several decades
[@Pedersen2011a]. Data from these registries can in turn be linked to sources of
data that contain metabolic phenotyping (e.g. in cohorts). However,
appropriately dealing with this structure and scale of data is challenging from
conceptual, analytical, and computational perspectives. Analytic methods for
dealing with this type of complicated data are being developed but are not yet
fully implemented. Causal reasoning, an area of active development in
epidemiology [@Pearl2010b;@Richmond2014a;@laBastide-vanGemert2014a], and pathway
(mediation) analysis techniques are methods that, with some adjustments, have
the potential to fully exploit these complex, high-dimensional datasets.

### Main research question

The overarching goal for my project is to better quantify and understand the
impact that early life conditions have on adult metabolic capacity and the risk
for incident T2D in adulthood. There are three primary objectives (O):

### Objectives

1. O1 is to investigate how specific early life conditions affect the risk of
T2D in adulthood at the level of an entire country (Denmark).
2. O2 is to identify the mediating pathways that adult metabolic capacity may
have between exposure to adversity in early life and risk for incident T2D.
3. O3 is to extend and generalise the statistical algorithm NetCoupler
(currently in development at: https://github.com/ClemensWittenbecher/NetCoupler)
that estimates direct and mediating pathways in high dimensional metabolic data
(e.g. metabolomics); this technique is required to complete O2.

### Hypotheses

## Research design and methods

O1 will answer: a) how individual components of early life conditions compare in
their contributions to T2D risk, b) how subtler forms of adversity (e.g.
parental conflict such as divorce, parental socio-economic deprivation, recent
immigration) contribute to T2D risk, c) whether there is a non-linear relationship
between early life conditions and T2D risk. Early life conditions include but are
not limited to: parental divorce, death of a parent, neighbourhood area
deprivation, parental education, childhood hospital admissions, recent
immigration, and parental health status.

Denmark has a unique system for collecting and storing comprehensive social,
economic, and health outcome (e.g. T2D diagnoses) data on all residents. The
registers date back several decades and are linkable by individual ID with other
data sources (e.g. cohorts, randomised trials). From these databases, I can
obtain detailed data on early life conditions on all residents of Denmark. The
registers I will use are listed in Table 1. Since working with such
massive and diverse data is a monumental task, the Big Data Centre for
Environment and Health (BERTHA), coordinated by Professor Clive Sabel at Aarhus
University, was recently initiated. BERTHA aims to build an infrastructure and
support network for working with, using, and linking the register databases to
other data sources to study a wide variety of exposures and their influence on
health. I 
will be collaborating with BERTHA researchers and the center to assist
me with O1 and O2.

To analyse the register data for O1, I will use a technique known as Lexis
[@Plummer2011a] objects. This allows me to use Poisson regression models to
obtain incidence rates and rate ratios, comparing disease incidence between
people exposed and not exposed to early life adversity. Lexis classes account
for time-dependent factors (e.g. age at first exposure, birth cohort effects). To
determine the contribution of individual early life conditions on risk for T2D
(for a and b), I will run several models with each early life condition as a
determinant. To
determine whether greater adversity or longer duration of adversity leads to
greater risk (i.e. non-linearity) (for c), I will test for non-linearity by
including non-linear and duration terms in the models.

O2 will identify: a) which metabolic pathways contribute the most to adult T2D
risk in people exposed to early life adversity, and b) which of these metabolic
pathways could be effective targets for mitigating risk. For this, I require
data on early life conditions and incident T2D that comes from the Danish
registers, and detailed adult metabolic data (e.g. standard metabolic profile or
metabolomics) that comes from cohorts or randomized trials. Through Denmark's
unique resident identification system, I am able to link these two sources of
data. The main cohort datasets I will use are listed in Table 1 and include the
Diet, Cancer, and Health Next Generations (DCH-NG) study (an extension of the
DCH cohort [@Tjoenneland2007a] and with collaborator Dr. Overvad on the steering
committee), EPIC-InterAct (a portion of the participants were recruited from
Denmark) [@Consortium2011a], and the ADDITION-DK [@Lauritzen2000a] cohort (Dr.
Witte is on the steering committee). The cohorts contain metabolomics data, a
spectrum of fatty acids, inflammatory markers, and standard metabolic variables
(e.g. lipoproteins and triacylglycerides).

The specific steps for O2 are to: 1) link the cohort metabolic data to the
registers; 2) extract and characterise the early life adversity variables; 3)
extract and characterise the disease incidence data; and, 4) use the NetCoupler
algorithm (described in O3) to determine how the entire metabolic profile
measured in mid-adulthood mediates the association between early life adversity
and risk of incident T2D in mid-to-late adulthood. Through this approach, I
can identify the contributions that individual metabolic variables have on T2D
risk and how early life modifies these metabolites. For instance, the results
may indicate that certain lipids, i.e. palmitic acid (16:0) or palmitoleic acid
(16:1 n-7), are higher in those exposed to early life adversity and that these
lipids contribute to a greater disease risk.

There are several ways to analyse high-dimensional metabolic data. For O2, the
approach I will use to answer my question is a form of pathway analysis.
However, there are limitations to most pathway techniques [@Asvatourian2018a],
which I aim to overcome by using a process called causal structure learning
[@Petersen2014a]. The strengths of this method over others are a) the ability to
use high dimensional data without needing to construct an a priori directed
acyclic graph (DAG), b) to estimate the most probable directions of the
pathways, and c) to identify the most likely causal DAG structure given the
data. I initiated
and am collaborating with Dr Clemens Wittenbecher from the German Institute of
Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam, Germany to generalise and deploy an algorithm
to exploit this process (NetCoupler). Dr Wittenbecher developed the
NetCoupler-algorithm for his research on diet, metabolomics, and incidence of
T2D [@Wittenbecher2017a]. It iterates through multiple possible DAGs to find
whether a set of pathways in a metabolomics network are most likely to have a
causal link with disease incidence.

### Variables

- Explanatory variables

- Outcome variables

- Confounding variables

### Inclusion and exclusion criteria

TODO: Insert Lexis diagram

Those born between 1920 and 1965 could hypothetically be included in the diabetes
register for those older than 30 at the time the register was created. This would
represent the "closed cohort".

Those born between 1965 and 1990 could potentially be included in the diabetes
register since its creation and assuming minimum age for T2D is 30 or older.
This cohort and those from the "closed cohort" would both make up the "open cohort".

## Discussion

This approach is necessary for a few reasons. First, quantifying the
contributions of individual variables in high-dimensional data that includes
exposures and outcomes requires a method that considers the inherent
interdependence of metabolic variables. Second, using a graph-based approach
will find and quantify mediating associations. Third, the direction of
association between metabolic variables, early life factors, and T2D from the
graph is vital to appropriately infer biological links, and to ultimately reach
an inference about the causal structure behind observed associations.

### Limitations

### Potential sources of bias

#### Measurement biases and errors

- How to test assumptions about a variable

#### Misclassification bias

#### Unmeasured confounding

#### Missing data

#### Changing eligibility

## Conclusion

The rise of the digital era and of big data has presented a number of
challenges and opportunities to modern epidemiology. While big data offers
valuable datasets for use in health research, the expertise and tools for
analysing this data are still limited. The innovative analytical tool from this
project will fully exploit complex datasets for further etiological research,
which I will bundle and disseminate as an R software package. I will use this
analytic tool for the present project and for my future research.
My project's results will provide etiological insight into how
exposure to adversity in early life modifies adult metabolic capacity, which may
subsequently reveal pecific metabolic patterns (e.g. more circulating
long-chain, saturated fatty acids) or more (or less) of specific metabolites
(e.g. less n-3 fatty acids) that contribute to T2D risk. These changes
in metabolism could be used as targets for individual level prevention or
management in those exposed to adversity in early life.
