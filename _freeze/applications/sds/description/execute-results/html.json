Its development depends\non the timing and accumulation of exposures throughout the life-course.\nIn addition to genetic influences, behavioral risk factors and\nsocioeconomic conditions cluster in families and are passed through\ngenerations. For instance, poor childhood socioeconomic status (SES) can\nimpact final educational attainment, adult SES, and lifestyle and\nbehavioral characteristics, which ultimately influence an individual's\nmetabolic capacity to regulate glucose and subsequent risk for diabetes.\n\n## Purpose\n\n<!-- The purpose of the project is briefly formulated. -->\n\nThe overall aim of this project is to identify the contributions of\nfamily and early life determinants on the development, management,\neconomics, and care of diabetes and the diseases that may arise\nfollowing a diabetes diagnosis, under a life-course framework.\n\n## The problem of the project\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \nPreferably formulated as the specific question or questions to which the \nconclusion must answer.\n-->\n```\n\nSome of our questions include:\n\n1.  Are some metabolic characteristics affected more by early life\n    conditions than others?\n2.  Knowing the above and knowing an adult individual's history during\n    early life, could we intervene and target specific metabolic\n    characteristics to lower the risk for T2DM?\n3.  Do some early life conditions affect an adult individual's metabolic\n    status and risk for disease more than other conditions?\n4.  Are long-term diabetes outcomes (nephropathy, eye disease, premature\n    death) affected by treatment persistence and stability in patients\n    with psychiatric comorbidity?\n5.  To what extent does the family network (e.g. parents, grandparents,\n    siblings) and family environment influence the risk for developing\n    type 2 diabetes in adulthood?\n\n## Data and Method\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \nHow will the project respond to the problem? What data will be used? How should\ndata be used?\n-->\n```\n\nWe intend to use the requested data from both SDS and DST registers, as\nwell as data from Danish cohort studies, to apply causal and predictive\nstatistical methods that best model associations for our questions and\ncompare how various public health strategies might impact the\nprevention, economics, and management of diabetes and the diseases that\nfollow its diagnosis.\n\nBecause we intend to try to answer questions that involve any\nindividual's early life and early childhood conditions, we need data on\ntheir parents. Likewise, to understand the role that the family network,\nincluding siblings and grandparents, has on diabetes risk, we need a\nlarge enough population to make these linkages and to adequately study\nthis area. Given the complicated nature of linking and constructing\nfamily networks, we need data on not just the individual but also the\nfamily in order to obtain the data we need to answer our questions.\n\n## Publication of results\n\n<!-- How and when are the results of the research planned to be published? -->\n\nWe will disseminate the results of the planned research project through\npre-print archives, conference presentations, journal articles, and\nthrough blogs and other social media outlets. Results will only be\npublished in open access scientific outlets.\n\n## Perspective\n\n<!-- What knowledge of societal relevance can this study contribute to? -->\n\nThis project will contribute to a broader and deeper understanding of\nthe role that these factors play with the development and progression of\ndiabetes.\n\nUnderstanding how early life and familial factors can influence diabetes\nprovides us with tools and knowledge to better target, intervene, and\neither prevent or manage diabetes and its complications. Considering the\nimpact that diabetes as a disease itself and its related comorbidities\nhas at the personal, public health, and economic level, any improvement\nin knowledge can have major impacts.\n\n## Ethical considerations\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \nIf the project involves direct contact with citizens, for example questionnaire \nsurveys or intervention studies: What ethical considerations have been made in\nconnection with the direct involvement of citizens in the survey?\n-->\n```\n\nNo direct contact to citizens are made in this project.\n",
