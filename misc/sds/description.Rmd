# Introduction

<!-- Brief introduction to the area. -->

Diabetes is a complex, multi-factorial disease. Its development depends on the
timing and accumulation of exposures throughout the life-course. In addition to
genetic influences, behavioral risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cluster
in families and are passed through generations. For instance, poor childhood
socioeconomic status (SES) can impact final educational attainment, adult SES,
and lifestyle and behavioral characteristics, which ultimately influence an
individual's metabolic capacity to regulate glucose and subsequent risk for
diabetes.

# Purpose

<!-- The purpose of the project is briefly formulated. -->

The overall aim of this project is to identify the contributions of family and
early life determinants on the development, management, and care of diabetes and
the diseases that may arise following a diabetes diagnosis, under a life-course
framework.

# The problem of the project

<!-- 
Preferably formulated as the specific question or questions to which the 
conclusion must answer.
-->

# Data and Method

<!-- 
How will the project respond to the problem? What data will be used? How should
data be used?
-->

We intend to use 
For
this purpose, we will apply causal and predictive statistical methods to best
use the data available from the integrated data sources with an overarching goal
to model several potential public health strategies that might impact the
prevention and management of diabetes and the diseases that follow its
diagnosis. 

In order to identify familial relations through individuals' life course trajectory,
the population requested covers all individuals, who live or lived in Denmark 
from 1 January 1970 to 31 December 2020 (~8.5 million people). 
The family linkage and structure makes the construction of the population
complicated and we will do this ourselves. For that we need the entire
population because we need data on not just the individual, but also the family
(parents and siblings). To characterise early life and early childhood
conditions of an individual person, we need data on their parents. Likewise, to
understand the role that the family network, including siblings and
grandparents, has on diabetes risk, we need a large enough population to make
these linkages and to adequately study this area.
Key requirements are:

- All index individuals born or who migrated into Denmark on or after 1970-01-01.
- All family members of the index individuals, including parents, siblings,
spouses, and children.

# Publication of results

<!-- How and when are the results of the research planned to be published? -->

We will disseminate the results of the planned research project through
pre-print archives, conference presentations, journal articles, and through
blogs and other social media outlets. Results will only be 

Results will be published in open access scientific outlets and presented at
scientific conferences.

# Perspective

<!-- What knowledge of societal relevance can this study contribute to? -->

This project will contribute to a broader and deeper understanding of the role
that these factors play with the development and progression of diabetes. 

Understanding how early life and familial factors can influence diabetes provides
us with tools and knowledge to better target, intervene, and either
prevent or manage diabetes and its complications. Considering the impact that
diabetes as a disease itself and its related comorbidities has at the personal,
public health, and economic level, any improvement in knowledge can have major 
impacts.


# Ethical considerations

<!-- 
If the project involves direct contact with citizens, for example questionnaire 
surveys or intervention studies: What ethical considerations have been made in
connection with the direct involvement of citizens in the survey?
-->

No direct contact to citizens are made in this project.
